In the `app/patient/symptoms` page, we have to enhance the response in such a way we get an 
 - List of the hospitals near the location(sent along with the prompt)
 - For respective hospitals providing the path as provided in the google maps app in mobile in works route 
 -Integrate local medical facility recommendations directly into the AI diagnosis output (currently, hospital locator is a separate feature and not part of the AI's response).
 - Implement offline feature (currently missing; required for rural/remote accessibility).
 - Improve mobile responsiveness and PWA structure (website is not well structured for mobile screens).
 - Integrate telemedicine (video consult) suggestions directly into the AI diagnosis output (currently, telemedicine is available but not recommended by the AI as part of the analysis flow).
 - The partially satisfied points from the hackathon expected outcome analysis should be listed for future improvement.
